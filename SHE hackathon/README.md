# Depression Detection using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to detect depression using a machine learning model in Python. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction steps.

## How to Run in VS Code

1. **Install Python**: Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed on your system.
2. **Install Required Extensions**: Ensure the Python extension is enabled in VS Code.
